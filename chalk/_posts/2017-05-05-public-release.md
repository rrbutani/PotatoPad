Hi! It's been a while...

Originally, we meant to actually post here while we worked on this project, as a way to document it, but that didn't really work out. Posts were delayed due to changing requirements and designs and in the end altogether abandoned. In the beginning it didn't really make sense to write about stuff that might not even be relevant to the project by the end of it and by the end we were so pressed for time that documenting our progress was entirely an afterthought.

But anyways, the project is formally over now, with the bi-annual 319K Superfinals having been held earlier today. And I'm proud to say that report that our project was well and alive, 3D graphics, dual PCBs, potatoes and all:

Now that the project is formally over, a couple of things to mention:

## Public Release

As of today, we're making all the code, assets, and auxillary data (in other words, our Github Repo) available to the world. As mentioned [in the previous post]({{ site.url }}/posts/2017-03-25-first-port.md), our repo is under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) meaning you're free to use it's contents essentially as you please.

## Rebrand

Additionally, as of today we're now PotatoPad instead of JankPad. We've graduated from jank status to [potato status](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/695279873284149250/Ygp6NQBp.jpg).

## The future

Even though this project is _formally_ over, we don't intend to stop here. There's still a lot to be done on both the hardware and software sides and we have much planned for the future. The next couple of weeks are going to be pretty busy (finals, end of the term, etc.) but things should pick up after then. Watch this space.

Until next time, <br/>
